# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: August 19, 2025*

**Kinex â€“ Gym Workouts** ("the Application"), available for mobile devices, and developed by **Mohammad Arif**, is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy outlines our practices concerning data.

This policy is also available for review within the Application's settings screen.

## **1\. Information We Collect**

The Application is designed to be used without requiring user accounts. All personal data you generate is stored locally on your device.

* **User-Provided Information:** When you create custom workout plans, the names of the plans and the list of exercises within them are stored locally on your device's database (Room). When you use the BMI Calculator, the weight, height, and unit preferences you enter are also saved locally on your device (DataStore) to enhance your experience. This information is not transmitted to any external server.
* **Automatically Collected Information:** The Application uses third-party services for analytics and crash reporting. This includes:
    * **Usage Data:** We use Google Analytics for Firebase to collect anonymous usage data to understand how the Application is being used and to improve its features. This includes information like your device type, session duration, and interactions with the app's features.
    * **Crash Data:** We use Firebase Crashlytics to automatically collect crash reports. This data helps us diagnose and fix bugs. The reports contain information about the device state at the time of the crash but do not personally identify you.

## **2\. How We Use Your Information**

We use the information we collect to:

* Provide and maintain the core functionality of the Application, such as saving your custom workout plans and BMI data on your device.
* Improve the Application by analyzing anonymous usage patterns and crash reports.
* Ensure the security and stability of our services.

## **3\. Data Storage and Security**

Your custom workout data and BMI preferences are stored locally on your device using Android's internal storage (Room Database and DataStore). This data does not leave your device. The Application also retrieves a general catalog of exercises, muscle groups, and equipment from our backend provider, Supabase, to populate the app's library. This is a one-way data fetch and does not involve sending any of your personal information.

## **4\. Third-Party Services**

The Application uses third-party services that have their own privacy policies. We recommend you review their policies:

* [Supabase Privacy Policy](https://supabase.com/privacy) (for providing the exercise catalog)
* [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) (for Firebase services)

## **5\. Children's Privacy**

The Application is not intended for use by children under the age of 13\. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13\.

## **6\. Changes to This Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
